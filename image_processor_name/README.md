# Image Name Processor

A Python application that automatically generates descriptive filenames for images using AI. It can watch directories for new images and rename them based on their content using the Ollama LLaVA model.

## Features

- AI-powered descriptive filename generation using LLaVA model
- Directory watching for automatic processing of new images
- Supports multiple image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG)
- Safe file operations with retry mechanisms
- Image verification before processing
- Clean filename generation (alphanumeric with hyphens)
- Detailed logging for monitoring and debugging
- Memory management with garbage collection

## Prerequisites

- **UV** (Python package manager)
- **Ollama** with LLaVA model installed and running

### Installing Prerequisites

1. Install UV:

    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

2. Install Ollama from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai/)
3. Pull the LLaVA model: `ollama pull llava:13b`
4. Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Watch a directory
uv run src/image_processor_name/main.py /path/to/directory

# Process a single file
uv run src/image_processor_name/main.py /path/to/image.jpg
```

## Usage Examples

### Watch Directory Mode

Run the script to monitor a directory for new images:

```bash
# Watch Desktop for new images
uv run src/image_processor_name/main.py ~/Desktop

# Watch Downloads folder
uv run src/image_processor_name/main.py ~/Downloads
```

The script will:

- Monitor the specified directory for new image files
- Automatically process and rename new images as they appear
- Continue running until interrupted (Ctrl+C)

### Single File Mode

Process a specific image file:

```bash
uv run src/image_processor_name/main.py path/to/image.jpg
```

The script will:

- Verify the image file
- Generate a descriptive name using AI
- Safely rename the file
- Exit after processing

## Technical Details

### Safety Features

1. **File Verification**:
   - Validates image files before processing
   - Ensures files are completely written before renaming
   - Uses PIL for image integrity checks

2. **Safe File Operations**:
   - Copy-then-delete strategy for safe moves
   - Multiple retry attempts for file operations
   - Garbage collection to prevent file handle issues
   - Delay mechanisms to ensure file system stability

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive logging of all operations
   - Graceful failure handling
   - Detailed error messages for debugging

### AI Integration

- Uses Ollama's LLaVA model for image analysis
- Generates concise 4-5 word descriptions
- Converts descriptions to clean filenames:
  - Lowercase conversion
  - Special character removal
  - Space replacement with hyphens

### Memory Management

- Active garbage collection after file operations
- Handle cleanup after image processing
- Resource management for long-running operations

## Example Transformations

Original filenames → AI-generated names:

- `IMG_20231220_193001.jpg` → `a-rocket-launch.jpg`
- `Screenshot_2023.png` → `girl-eating-donut-smiling.png`
- `DSC_0123.jpg` → `man-smoking-cigarette-and-wearing-suit.jpg`

## Troubleshooting

1. **File Access Issues**:
   - Ensure proper permissions on directories
   - Check for file locks from other applications
   - Verify sufficient disk space

2. **AI Service Issues**:
   - Confirm Ollama is running (`http://localhost:11434`)
   - Verify LLaVA model is installed
   - Check network connectivity

3. **Memory Issues**:
   - Monitor system resources during operation
   - Consider processing fewer files simultaneously
   - Ensure adequate system memory
